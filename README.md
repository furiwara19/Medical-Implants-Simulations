# Microdosimetric Investigation of the Effect of Medical Implants in Radiotherapy
This project investigates the biological effects of medical implants in radiotherapy using a **microdosimetric approach**.
Due to differences in the densities of various implants (e.g., titanium, gold), 
their impact on **radiation absorption, scattering, and secondary particle production** can have a crucial influence on treatment planning. 
This study aims to evaluate these effects with high precision.
